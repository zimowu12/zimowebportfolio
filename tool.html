                    This is a client project that I worked on with 5 other team members for the company Buffalo Buffalo. We enhanced the Level Design Editor Tool in Unity for their game Fresh Tracks.

                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>BuffaloBuffalo is a Vancouver-based game studio focusing on original and immersive experiences. 
                    The goal for the working team is to create 2 levels for the client’s VR project “Fresh Track”, 
                    and also improve the user experience for the Level Editor in Unity.
                <br>
                Fresh Tracks is a music-based VR action game on skis with highly adaptive audio. The main goal of this proposal is to 
                have the CDM team validate the core interactions of Fresh Tracks, an upcoming music-based action game designed primarily 
                for Virtual Reality currently in the prototype phase. </p>
                <h4>Process</h4>
                <p>The Chunk Editor that we were given, operates primarily through the ChunkDesigner_Scene script, affectionately known as CHUNKY among friends and foe, it boasts over 3,000 lines of code, CHUNKY's comprehensive set of features forms the backbone of our design process. 
                    However, its size and complexity made direct integrations challenging, leading to the decision to encapsulate new features in separate classes, adhering to the principle of separation of concerns.</p>
                    <h4>Modifications</h4>
                <p>
                    The script ChunkDesigner_Scene, Or CHUNKY as it is called among friends, is a massive monster of a 3000+ lines chunker of a script, its enormous size only overshadowed by its importance.
                    At first we Tried to gently put our code into this humongous beast, but quickly gave up in favor of a more separated approach.
                    </p>

                <p>Here's a recording of what the editor tool looked like when we first got it:</p>

                    <p> Here's what we implemented: </p>
                    <video src="images/Tool/editor_final_product.mp4" controls width="800">Trailer</video> 
                    <p>As per our client’s request, we conducted interviews with the company’s level designers to identify and address key pain points. 
                        We collaborated with both our internal team and the clients to agree on three main features that we would focus on fixing, aiming to make them as bug-free as possible.</p>\
                    <h4>Features</h4>
                    <p> The three features that we implemented were Multi-selection Drag Box, Gizmo System, and UI Minimize windows. We always kept user-centric design in mind.
                        We have conducted many tests with both our internal level designers and Buffalo Buffalo’s level designers. Every new feature undergoes internal testing by our team, primarily through integrating the new code into their branch once we consider it stable enough for an internal release. The level designer then employs the new function while designing a level, deliberately attempting to break it with the intent of uncovering any minor flaws. Once deemed stable, it is showcased to the client during meetings, where they can test, provide feedback, and suggest adjustments. Additionally, minor improvements are continuously tested throughout the week by uploading them to an external testing branch, with the client's level designer being informed of any adjustments that need to be tested. The ultimate test of our enhancements to the level designer tool is conducted by Buffalo’s newly hired level designer who has only had experience with the unimproved tool. 
                        Interviews will usually be formed after testing and feedback will be given.
